# mc_noodles

Noodles is a loose collection of useful MODO utility scripts for things like renaming and reordering items in the items list and shader tree, removing useless cruft from scenes, and other goodies. It was originally developed by Mechanical Color LLC as a proprietary paid product, and is now released as open-source under the MIT license.
